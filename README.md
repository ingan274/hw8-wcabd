I was inspired by the animations and data visualizations of <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/ml-fairness-for-marketers/"> “Think with Google” machine leaning page </a> that explore how 44 people talk about bias. I wanted to break apart Sara Hendren’s book “What Can a Dody Do?” and pull key quotes and information to visually illustrate her key point of every chapter.

<br/>
Each page would have their own single scroll information page that focuses on how those with disabilities adapt to the build world and how we, as designers, should learn to adapt the built world to all types of people. 
<br/>
I created animations that immerse the viewer in understanding how we should explore the hidden assumptions that our everyday environment is built on. My intention through each page is a reflection of the 5 main chapters of the book (Limb, Chair, Room, Street, Clock) so that each page provides the viewer a new way to viewing a part of their life.
